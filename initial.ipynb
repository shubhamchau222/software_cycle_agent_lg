       "   - As a user, I want to be able to manage my profile information, so that I can keep my account up-to-date.\n",
       "   - Acceptance Criteria:\n",
       "     - The user can view and edit their profile information.\n",
       "     - The user can update their password and other account settings.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step 3: Address Dependencies & Constraints\n",
       "\n",
       "- **External Dependencies:**\n",
       "  - The application will use a third-party API for email verification and password hashing.\n",
       "  - The application will use a database to store user data and recipe information.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Constraints:**\n",
       "  - The application must follow the standard UI/UX guidelines for login and registration pages.\n",
       "  - The application must ensure password security and encryption.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step 4: Provide Context & Instructions\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Background Information:**\n",
       "  - The application will be a web-based platform for users to store and manage their recipes.\n",
       "  - The application will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework such as Node.js.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **UI/UX Guidelines:**\n",
       "  - The login and registration pages must follow standard UI/UX guidelines for input fields and buttons.\n",
       "  - The dashboard and recipe listing pages must be visually appealing and easy to navigate.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Technical Notes:**\n",
       "  - The application will use a RESTful API for backend communication.\n",
       "  - The application will use a library such as Passport.js for authentication and authorization.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step 5: Prioritize & Break Down Stories\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Prioritization:**\n",
       "  - The login and registration stories have the highest priority, as they are essential for user authentication and authorization.\n",
       "  - The recipe storage and management stories have the next highest priority, as they are essential for user functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Breaking Down Stories:**\n",
       "  - Story 1 (User Login) can be broken down into smaller tasks such as handling user input, checking credentials, and redirecting to the dashboard.\n",
       "  - Story 2 (User Registration) can be broken down into smaller tasks such as handling user input, checking for existing email addresses, and redirecting to the login page.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step 6: Communicate & Collaborate\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Team Communication:**\n",
       "  - The team will communicate through regular meetings and stand-ups to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n",
       "  - The team will use collaboration tools such as Trello or Asana to track progress and assign tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Stakeholder Communication:**\n",
       "  - The stakeholders will be kept informed through regular updates and demos.\n",
       "  - The stakeholders will be involved in the testing and validation process to ensure the application meets their requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Step 7: Review & Iterate\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Review Process:**\n",
       "  - The team will review the completed stories with stakeholders to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.\n",
       "  - The team will iterate on the stories to address any issues or concerns.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Iteration:**\n",
       "  - The team will iterate on the stories to ensure they meet the requirements and are testable.\n",
       "  - The team will refine the stories to ensure they are clear and concise."

      "For each story, we need to define clear criteria for completion. Here are some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Story 1: Add Recipe\n",
      "\n",
      "- The user can successfully add a new recipe with the required fields (name, ingredients, instructions).\n",
      "- The new recipe is saved to the user's collection and can be viewed in the browse screen.\n",
      "- The user can edit and delete the newly added recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Story 2: View Stored Recipes\n",
      "\n",
      "- The user can view a list of all stored recipes in the browse screen.\n",
      "- Each recipe in the list displays the name, ingredients, and instructions.\n",
      "- The user can click on a recipe to view its details.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Story 3: Edit Recipe\n",

      "- The deleted recipe is removed from the user's browse screen.\n",
      "- The user receives a confirmation message after deletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Address Dependencies & Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to identify any external dependencies or constraints that may impact the development of these stories. Some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Integration with a database to store and retrieve recipe data.\n",
      "- Implementation of user authentication and authorization to restrict access to recipe data.\n",
      "- Adherence to specific UI/UX guidelines for the app's design and layout.\n",
      "\n",

      "- Implementation of a user profile system to manage user authentication and authorization.\n",
      "- Adherence to specific design guidelines for the app's UI and UX.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Prioritize & Break Down Stories\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to assess the priorities of each story, break down large stories into smaller ones, and estimate the effort required for each story. Some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prioritize the \"Add Recipe\" story as high-priority since it's the primary feature of the app.\n",
      "- Break down the \"Add Recipe\" story into smaller stories, such as \"Add Recipe Fields\" and \"Save Recipe to Database\".\n",
      "- Estimate the effort required for each story and create a project plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Communicate & Collaborate\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to maintain open communication with the development team, ensuring clarity and answering any questions they may have. This includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Regularly updating the development team on the project's progress and any changes to the requirements.\n",
      "- Providing necessary resources and support to help the development team overcome any challenges.\n",
      "- Encouraging collaboration and feedback between the development team and stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Review & Iterate\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to review completed stories with stakeholders, gather feedback, and iterate as needed. This includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reviewing the completed \"Add Recipe\" story with stakeholders and gathering feedback.\n",
      "- Addressing any concerns or issues raised by stakeholders and iterating on the story as needed.\n",
      "- Continuously monitoring and improving the app's performance, user experience, and features based on stakeholder feedback.\n"

This involves creating a digital platform where users can save, organize, and manage their favorite recipes.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\\n\\n- **Gather Requirements:**\\n  - The app should allow users to save recipes with ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.\\n  - Users should be able to organize recipes into categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).\\n  - The app should provide a search functionality to easily find specific recipes.\\n  - Users should be able to add and manage their personal cooking notes.\\n\\n- **Clarify Ambiguities:**\\n  - Will the app allow users to create new recipes from scratch or only save existing ones?\\n  - Will the app integrate with any popular recipe APIs or rely on user-submitted content?\\n\\n### Step 2: Create User Stories\\n\\nHere are some initial user stories based on the requirements:\\n\\n- **User Story 1:** \\n  *As a user, I want to be able to save a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so that I can easily access and cook my favorite dishes.*\\n\\n- **User Story 2:** \\n  *As a user, I want to be able to organize my recipes into categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), so that I can quickly find specific types of recipes.*\\n\\n- **User Story 3:** \\n  *As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes by name, ingredient, or cooking time, so that I can easily find and try new recipes.*\\n\\n- **User Story 4:** \\n  *As a user, I want to be able to add and manage my personal cooking notes for each recipe, so that I can refine my cooking skills and adapt recipes to my taste.*\\n\\n### Step 3: Define Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- **User Story 1:**\\n  - Acceptance Criteria:\\n    - The user can submit a new recipe with ingredients and instructions.\\n    - The recipe is saved in the user's account.\\n    - The user can view and edit the saved recipe.\\n\\n- **User Story 2:**\\n  - Acceptance Criteria:\\n    - The user can select a category for each saved recipe.\\n    - The user can view recipes organized by category.\\n    - The user can add new categories.\\n\\n- **User Story 3:**\\n  - Acceptance Criteria:\\n    - The user can search for recipes by name, ingredient, or cooking time.\\n    - The search results are displayed in a list.\\n    - The user can filter search results by category.\\n\\n- **User Story 4:**\\n  - Acceptance Criteria:\\n    - The user can add notes to a saved recipe.\\n    - The user can view and edit notes for a saved recipe.\\n    - Notes are stored in the user's account.\\n\\n### Step 4: Address Dependencies & Constraints\\n\\n- **External Dependencies:**\\n  - Recipe API integration.\\n  - Social sharing functionality (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).\\n\\n- **Constraints:**\\n  - Recipe data storage and retrieval.\\n  - Mobile app compatibility.\\n\\n### Step 5: Provide Context & Instructions\\n\\n- **Background:**\\n  - The app will be a mobile-first application.\\n  - Recipe data will be stored in a cloud-based database.\\n\\n- **UI/UX Guidelines:**\\n  - Recipes should be displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format.\\n  - Categories and search results should be displayed in a list or grid.\\n\\n- **Technical Notes:**\\n  - Recipe data will be stored in a JSON format.\\n  - Recipes will be displayed using a template engine (e.g., Mustache).\\n\\n### Step 6: Prioritize & Break Down Stories\\n\\n- **Prioritization:**\\n  - User Story 1: Saving recipes (high priority).\\n  - User Story 2: Organizing recipes (medium priority).\\n  - User Story 3: Searching recipes (medium priority).\\n  - User Story 4: Adding notes (low priority).\\n\\n- **Breaking Down Stories:**\\n  - **User Story 1:** \\n    - Break down into smaller tasks:\\n      1. Create the recipe submission form.\\n      2. Implement saving recipes to the database.\\n      3. Display saved recipes in the user's account.\\n\\n  - **User Story 2:**\\n    - Break down into smaller tasks:\\n      1. Create the category selection interface.\\n      2. Implement saving and retrieving recipes by category.\\n      3. Display recipes organized by category.\\n\\n  - **User Story 3:**\\n    - Break down into smaller tasks:\\n      1. Create the search interface.\\n      2. Implement searching recipes by name, ingredient, or cooking time.\\n      3. Display search results in a list.\\n\\n  - **User Story 4:**\\n    - Break down into smaller tasks:\\n      1. Create the note submission interface.\\n      2. Implement adding notes to a saved recipe.\\n      3. Display notes for a saved recipe.\\n\\n### Step 7: Communicate & Collaborate\\n\\n- **Team Communication:**\\n  - Hold regular meetings to discuss progress and address questions.\\n  - Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Trello) to track progress and discuss tasks.\\n\\n### Step 8: Review & Iterate\\n\\n- **Review Completed Stories:**\\n  - Meet with stakeholders to review completed user stories.\\n  - Gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.\\n\\n- **Iterate & Refine:**\\n  - Refine user stories based on feedback and iteration.\\n  - Prioritize and break down new user stories as needed.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1147, 'prompt_tokens': 354, 'total_tokens': 1501, 'completion_time': 1.5293333329999999, 'prompt_time': 0.013818481, 'queue_time': 0.049257763, 'total_time': 1.543151814}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_465c5d391d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d1c67a15-4932-408e-8a3b-99924294d4d9-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 354, 'output_tokens': 1147, 'total_tokens': 1501})]}"
